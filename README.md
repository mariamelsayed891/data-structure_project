# data-structure_project
C++ project combining Linked List and Binary Search Tree (BST) with GUI for dynamic data management, insertion, search, and sorted display.
# Linked List & Binary Search Tree Project

## Description
This C++ project combines a *dynamic Linked List* and a *Binary Search Tree (BST)*. Users can manage data efficiently through both sequential (Linked List) and sorted (BST) views.

## Features
- *Linked List Operations*
  - Insert node at beginning, end, or specific position
  - Delete node from beginning, end, or specific position
  - Search for a node by ID
  - Traverse and display all nodes

- *Binary Search Tree (Books)*
  - Insert books with ID and Title
  - Search for books by ID
  - Display all books in sorted order

- *Integration*
  - Move data from Linked List to BST with a single command
  - Maintain both sequential and sorted views of data

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/LinkedListBSTProject.git
